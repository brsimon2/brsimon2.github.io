      <h1>About Me</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I am currently a University of Illinois undergraduate pursuing a dual degree in Information Systems and Statistics from the Gies College of Business and the College of LAS. These degrees drive me toward a career where I will apply technology to problem-solving, lead and collaborate on interdisciplinary teams, and drive innovation.</p>
<p>On campus, I am a member of Illinois Business Council. I have gained leadership experience as a member of both the Charity Fundraising committee and the Technology committee. I have had the opportunity to lead events that educate other members in the field of technology, and raise both awareness and funds for charity. I am also a consultant for SCNO (Students Consulting for Non-Profit Organizations). I am currently assisting a PwC consultant in establishing a non-profit children’s daycare center in downtown Chicago by conducting market research and competitive analysis.
Through my work in Illinois Business Council and SCNO, I have gained valuable professional skills, while assisting the underserved in local communities and around the globe.</p>
<p>Professionally, I interned at Zebra Technologies Corporation this past summer as a Business Analyst Intern. During this internship, I had the opportunity to develop an inventory optimization tool, which generated initial savings of approximately $7 million. This tool integrated multiple technologies including Oracle Business Intelligence, Microsoft Access, Power BI, and PowerApps. I also gained experience with other software applications such as Microsoft Flow, and Microsoft’s Visual Basic programming language. Additionally, I have interned at INTREN, INC. as a Supply Chain Management Intern. In this role, I was responsible for creating and distributing weekly cost analysis reports to identify key areas for improved equipment optimization. I also learned how to utilize various technologies such as SQL and Excel macros to build a replenishment model for various construction equipment products.</p>
