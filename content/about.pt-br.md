Self-motivated, detail-oriented and analytically-minded, I continually seek out opportunities to align my business education with my passion for technology and big data. As a business and data analyst, I have utilized data wrangling, validation, modeling, and visualization techniques to solve business problems, improve processes, and effectively communicate findings to business leaders.
