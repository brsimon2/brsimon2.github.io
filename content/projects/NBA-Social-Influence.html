<h1><strong>Dataset</strong></h1>
<p>This dataset includes the on-court performance of 100 NBA players alongside their social influence and salary for the 2016-2017 season. The main measurement of social influence for this study is the number of twitter followers that a player has.</p>

<h1><strong>Questions and Visualizations</strong></h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the relationship between a player’s salary and number of twitter followers?</li>
<li>Do players that score more points also have more twitter followers?</li>
<li>Is a player’s team related to the amount of social influence that they have?</li>
<li>Is there a correlation between age and twitter followers?</li>
<li>Do players that win more games have more twitter followers?</li>

<p><em>There appears to be a strong correlation between a player’s salary and number of twitter followers with an exponential growth rate.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Question 2</strong></h2>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = NBAData, mapping = aes(x = PTS,y = TWITTER_FOLLOWER_COUNT_MILLIONS)) +

<p><em>There appears to be a slight correlation between the number of points that a player scores and number of twitter followers they have, but not nearly as strong as the correlation between salary and twitter followers.</em></p>

<p><em>Based on the sample, some teams have significantly more twitter followers than other teams, so it seems that the team a player is on is related to the number of twitter followers they have. The Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors were both in the championship in 2016-2017, so it makes sense that they would have more social influence.</em></p>

<p><em>There doesn’t seem to be a direct correlation between age and twitter folowwers, but it appears that the players with the most followers are in their late twenties and early thirties.</em></p>

<p><em>It looks like a player’s win percentage is not strongly correlated to the number of twitter followers they have, but the players with the most twitter followers also have a high win percentage (betweeen 0.6 and 0.8).</em></p>
